# Stats Preview Card 

This was my second ever Frontend challenge. I am proud of this one since it took me around 4 hours (less than double the time of my first challenge), and because my code is cleaner and more comprehensive. For example, I had my css in a different file this time. 

### Main Things I learned:
- Positioning elements (images, shapes, text)
- The <mark> tag can let me change the color of words within a string (title, paragraph, etc.)
- Image properties and being able to use filters 


### Things to Improve on:
- Figuring out how to change viewpoint for mobile devices
- Better HTML/CSS coding practices 

### Conclusion

This project was easier than I thought it was going to be, maybe scarily so... Going forwards I want to learn how to implement videos, animations, and interactive features!
